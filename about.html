      Meet Christian!
    </h1>
    
    
     <h3>
      Hello, thanks for visiting my page! My name is Christian and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Information Technology and Informatics at Rutgers University - New Brunswick. 
    </h3>
    
    <h3>
       However, my education and background in technology goes back much further than my time here. As a kid, I always loved video games and thanks to my parents, I was able to stay pretty up to date on new systems and devices. As I got older, this naturally progressed into what some might call an obsession with computers. Starting in high school, I was apart of the Information Technology Academy at Red Bank Regional where I had the pleasure of taking part in programs such as AFA's CyberPatriot and Future Business Leaders of America. This truly fostered my love of technology and solidified the path I wanted to take going forward. 
    </h3>
    
    <h3>Now, as a student of ITI at Rutgers, I am able to really expand upon this natural curiosity I've always had and branch out into development languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Furthermore, the projects I've worked on have built up my skills in project management and team building, all while giving me hands on experience with crucial tools, theories, and principles. I plan to continue making the most out of my time here, continue challenging myself, and continue learning; inside and outside of the classroom.</h3>
