    <span class="title">This website!</span>
    <span class="desc"> Built from nothing besides what we learned this semester, I've put this website together for the final project of my Web Design class. We learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, giving me the skills needed to make cool slideshows like this. <br><br>(Click the numbers on the bottom! Seriously, try it!)</span>

    <span class="title">Figma Mobile App Prototype</span>
    <span class="desc">This was another really cool project I got to work on this semester thanks to my Human Computer Interaction class. Throughout the semester we learned about important design principles, Design Thinking, and went through the whole process of creating our own prototype of a mobile app. <br> <br> This class gave me a lot of hands on experience with Figma, prototyping, and conducting research through the use of interviews and usability testing. </span>

    <span class="title">Database Analyzation with Python </span>
    <span class="desc">Another fun project I worked on was for my Object Oriented Programming class. This class taught us the basics of programming in Python and with this knowledge I was able to take a database consisting of over 2,000,000 accounts and create a histogram showing how skill levels of the accounts were distributed. <br><br> This was achieved through the use of Python3 and multiple packages such as Pandas and MatPlotLib.  </span>
